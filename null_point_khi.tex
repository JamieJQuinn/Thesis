\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Why are nulls important?}

Null points are an abundant feature in the topologically complex magnetic field of the solar corona [TODO reference to estimate of null points] and are inferred to participate in a number of high-energy phenomena. One such important phenomena is the compact solar flare, thought to arise due to energetic reconnection events occurring in the vicinity of a null, resulting in a flare with a much shorter, brighter life than those associated with coronal loops. Due to the shape of the null, these flares are typically associated with a signatory circular flare ribbon. Null points are also susceptible to collapse, a process that has been theoretically shown to potentially produce oscillatory reconnection TODO ref. The dissipation mechanisms, primarily viscosity and resistivity, can have a strong effect on the dynamic development of the null, particularly the development of reconnection in and around the null point. Aside from the importance of investigating the effect of dissipation on such energetic phenomena, the null point, due to its variation in magnetic field strength, is also an ideal test for the recently developed model of anisotropic viscosity, the switching model. TODO MENTION PRIOR TESTS

Here, we consider an idealised null point which we dynamically stress by twisting the spine. Due to the high speed at which we do this, thin shear layers in the velocity develop along the fan plane which can become unstable to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The vortices created can then go on to promote reconnection in the fan plane. 

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Numerical setup}

The magnetic structure of the null point with the spine aligned along the $z$-axis is written
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:null_point_field}
  \vec{B} = (x, y, -2z).
\end{equation}
Since we wish to dynamically stress this null point, we let the initial velocity be uniformly zero, $\vec{u} = \vec{0}$. We also set a uniform density $\rho = 1$ and internal energy $\varepsilon = TODO$, corresponding to a temperature of $T = TODO$. At the upper and lower $z$-boundaries we impose a twisting motion centred around the axis of the null with a smooth, $\tanh$-shaped radial profile which is accelerated from stationary using a $\tanh^2$-shaped ramping function. The velocity at the upper boundary is explicitly written as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:null_twisting_profile}
  \vec{u} = u_0 u_r(r) u_t(t) (-y, x),
\end{equation}
where $u_r$ describes the radial profile of the twisting motion in terms of the radius $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:radial_twisting_function}
  u_r(r) = 1 + \tanh(1 - 36r^2),
\end{equation}
and $u_t(t)$ describes the imposed acceleration of the twisting motion,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ramping_up_function}
  u_t(t) = \tanh^2(t/t_r).
\end{equation}
The peak velocity after the ramping time is approximately $u_0$, At the lower boundary, the flow is in the opposite direction.

\subsection{Tools of analysis}

There are three quantities useful in understanding the stability of the current-vortex sheet. Associated with the shear in velocity and magnetic field are two Mach numbers: the fast mode Mach number, related to the velocity shear, and the projected Alfv\'en Mach number, related to the magnetic shear,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mach_numbers}
  M_f = \frac{\Delta v}{\sqrt{c_s^2 + c_A^2}} \quad \text{and} \quad M_A = \frac{\Delta v \sqrt{\rho}}{\Delta B},
\end{equation}
where $\Delta v$ and $\Delta B$ are the respective differences in the velocity and magnetic field over the shear layer, and $c_s$ and $v_A$ are the local sound and Alfv\'en speeds, respectively. Since the shear layer occurs in the presence of a guide field (that of the initial magnetic null point) which does not affect the linear stability of the KHI, we consider the Alfv\'en Mach number projected on to the layer TODO include diagram. The parameter describing the balance of stability between the tearing mode and the KHI in a current-vortex sheet is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:khi_stability_param}
  \Gamma = \frac{L_b}{L_v} M_A^{2/3}
\end{equation}
where $L_b$ and $L_v$ are the respective widths of the magnetic and velocity shear layers~\cite{einaudiResistiveInstabilitiesFlowing1986}. Again, due to the presence of the guide field, we consider $\Gamma$ projected on to the shear layer. Plotting the radial dependence of these quantities over the shear layers gives an idea of the probable stability. It should be noted that the stability analysis performed in reference~\cite{einaudiResistiveInstabilitiesFlowing1986} is under specific conditions. The presence of viscosity and the guide field in the system studied here require us to use their stability criteria as approximations.

TODO how did we calculate layer thickness, radius, peaks, etc

\section{Results}

\subsection{Evolution of a typical case}
\label{sec:null_point_khi_single_case}

We discuss initially the evolution of the pair of simulations using a resistivity of $\eta = 10^{-4}$ and viscosity $\nu = 10^{-4}$, comparing the two viscosity models. These simulations capture the main features of the null's response to the driver: the formation of a current-vortex sheet in the fan plane, the appearance of counterflows, the growth of both a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and a fluting instability, and an eventual null collapse. This specific choice of parameters also highlights the differences between the isotropic and the switching viscosity models, mainly the suppression of the KHI in the isotropic case.

The total kinetic energy reveals the main developments in the simulations (Figure~\ref{fig:v-4r-4_kinetic_energy}). The initial acceleration of the drivers and injection of torsional Alfv\'en waves occurs between $t=0$ and $2$. After this time the effect of the viscosity models becomes apparent; the energy associated with the KHI grows only in the switching case, peaking between $t=9$ and $10$. Considering only the switching case, the instability generates vortices in the fan plane, encouraging current formation and enhanced Ohmic heating which in turn results in a drop of kinetic energy between $t=10$ and $12$ as the kinetic energy is converted to heat. The current sheets created during the instability also permit small, localised reconnection events, indicated by small peaks in the kinetic energy between $t=10$ and $12$. Over the same time period, the isotropic case remains stable. After $t=12$ a secondary instability, the fluting instability, occurs in both cases. Without the influence of the KHI the isotropic case becomes unstable to the fluting instability at a later time. In turn, the fluting instability triggers the collapse of the null, indicated by the associated spike in kinetic energy at TODO.

\begin{figure}[t]

  \label{fig:v-4r-4_kinetic_energy}
\end{figure}

Initially, at $t=1$ the torsional Alfv\'en waves injected by the driver trace the field surrounding the null, moving towards the fan plane and out from the spine. The waves eventually meet and create an shear layer in the velocity and magnetic field in the form of a ring of vorticity and current density. Without any diffusion in the system the main wavefronts would travel far along the field before meeting. The presence of both viscosity and resistivity encourages the waves to diffuse as they travel along the field, allowing the upper and lower waves to meet relatively close to the spine, creating rings of shear which are both thicker and smaller in radius. In the switching case, due to the switching model diffusing the field less effectively than the isotropic model, the rings are typically larger in radius, stronger in magnitude, and thinner (Figure~\ref{fig:v-4r-4_vorticity_current_ring_t_3}). Since the viscosity diffuses velocity directly, and affects the magnetic field field through that, the vorticity is affected more than the current density.

\begin{figure}[t]

  \caption{}%
  \label{fig:v-4r-4_vorticity_current_ring_t_3}
\end{figure}

In the switching case, the velocity shear layer becomes unstable to the KHI, initially presenting as a low-amplitude perturbation overlaying the velocity structure associated with the boundaries (Figure~\ref{fig:v-4r-4_vz_z_0_t_2}). The shear layers created in the isotropic case do not exceed the required stability criteria[TODO expand on this or link back] and remain stable (Figure~\ref{fig:v-4r-4_mach_t_2}). Between times $t=2$ and $6$ magnetic tension opposes the direction of the driver and causes counterflows to appear (Figure~\ref{fig:v-4r-4_counterflows_t_6}) and the current-vortex sheet grows in both size and magnitude, more in the switching case than in the isotropic. The KHI also grows, still only in the switching case. At $t=6$, the reconnection rate is notably higher in the switching case, an indicator of more efficient slippage reconnection due to the lower effective viscosity allowing thinner and stronger current structures TODO FIG line plot of reconnection rate over time.

At $t=7$ the KHI has visibly spread along the fan plane (Figure~\ref{fig:v-4r-4_vz_z_0_t_7}) and by $t=9$ it's clearly visible in the vorticity and current density (Figure~\ref{fig:v-4r-4_vorticity_current_ring_t_9}), although the diagonals are more pronounced due to the effect of the boundaries. The shearing action of the counterflows produces a secondary ring of strong current density closer to the spine. The strength of the current density within the main current-vortex sheet suggests the instability is enhancing the reconnection rate. Indeed, at $t=10$ a branching pattern in the field-integrated parallel electric field provides further evidence for reconnection occurring locally in the rolls of the KHI (Figure~\ref{fig:v-4r-4_reconn_rate_swi_t_10}).

\end{figure}

While the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability grows in the fan plane in the switching case, both cases show growth of another instability located along the spine: the fluting instability. The competition between the inwardly directed magnetic tension in the spine, and the outwardly directed plasma pressure gradient gives rise to an interchange instability. During early stages of the instability, at around $t=6$, magnetic tension increases at four points around the centre axis. The position and number of these points are likely due to the influence of the boundaries. This perturbation in the tension is mirrored by a corresponding perturbation in the thermal pressure which acts to squeeze plasma radially outwards TODO fig of pressure, velocity and magnetic tension (or total force?). The instability continues to grow through $t=10$ with the outflows mixing with the TODO discuss dynamics of instablity after onset. 

Between $t=TODO$ and $t=TODO$ the fluting instability begins to grow (TODO this is different for switching and isotropic how?). Although this instability is influenced by the KHI and seems to influence the eventual collapse of the null, it is not a necessary component of either and so we present the relevant results here and relegate further details to chapter TODO. The instability is generated by the competition between thermal pressure and magnetic tension. 
TODO get story straight about what happens post-flute

At $t=13$ the instability appears to act as a trigger for extremely energetic reconnection in the spine, causing the numerical scheme to display artifacts in locations where the derivatives become too large. The inner

At $t=13$ the null shows some indication of beginning to reconnect and collapse, shown by the presence of velocity structures around the spine, mainly in the isotropic case. The inner ring of current density has shrunk and is now extremely strong, stronger in the isotropic case than the switching case, although we note the current structure located along the spine is around twice as strong as that around the null.

%Indeed, by $t=15$, the null is showing signs of collapse in the vorticity, the velocity and in a sudden decrease in current density at the null in the isotropic case.  Note the KHI is still present and the sheer size of the vorticity in the switching case (probably due to a numerical issues, we don't have much stabalising viscous damping in this simulation). It appears as though the presence of the KHI slows the shrinking of the inner current density ring, slowing the eventual collapse of the null.

\subsection{Analysis of parameter study}

The results shown in section~\ref{sec:null_point_khi_single_case} do not dramatically change when the viscosity $\nu$ is varied. However, the value of $\eta$ has a strong impact on the dynamics of the stressed null. Generally, increasing $\eta$ to $10^{-3}$ produces a null that remains unstable to the KHI (when using switching viscosity) but shows no sign of collapse. In contrast, decreasing $\eta$ to $10^{-5}$ causes the null to collapse much sooner than in the example case in section~\ref{sec:null_point_khi_single_case}, so much so that the KHI doesn't have time to develop nonlinearly, even in linearly unstable cases. We present first the quantitative effect of varying $\nu$, $\eta$ and the viscosity models on the properties of the shear layers and the resulting stability and development of the KHI. We then focus our analysis on the effect of only $\eta$ on the fluting instability and the null collapse, still comparing the two viscosity models.

As an aside, in all $\nu = 10^{-3}$ isotropic simulations there's an unexpected, transient artifact in every examined variable. This was also seen in the kink instability simulations in chapter TODO. This is assumed to be due to small-amplitude fast waves created during the initial ramp up, the interaction of which causes the isotropic viscous stress tensor to produce odd effects. It appears to only affect the first time step and the effect is only to slightly increase the viscous heating. Since the affected results don't differ wildly from those of the unaffected $\nu=10{-4}$ simulations we cautiously trust these results.

\subsubsection{Properties of the shear layers and resultant instability}

We consider here the effect of varying $\nu$ and $\eta$ on the properties of the vorticity and current density rings, comparing the two viscosity models. Properties of the rings such as thickness, radial extent and peak magnitude help to give an understanding of the stability of the current-vortex sheet to the KHI. Generally, these properties vary substantially with $\eta$ for both viscosity models, substantially with $\nu$ in the isotropic cases, but only weakly with $\nu$ in the switching cases. The initial lack of dependence on $\nu$ in the switching cases is expected since the tensor is nearly zero-valued until the breakup of the current-vortex sheet, during and after which the effect of $\nu$ is much more pronounced.

TODO 4 plots. Two for each ring, one radius and one thickness. Do similar to Fig 12 in Wyper \& Pontin

Both rings increase in radius as $\eta$ and $\nu$ decrease[TODO ref]. This is a result of the upper and lower Alfv\'en waves being able to travel further before diffusing into the fan plane and forming the shear layers. Due to the shape of the field, this allows the rings to form further from the spine in the radial direction. In the direction out of the fan plane, the thickness of both the current density and vorticity shear layers decreases with decreasing $\eta$ and $\nu$ [TODO plot of thickness over time over all params]. The respective diffusion parameter naturally affects the shear layer most associated with it, that is resistivity affecting the current density layer, and viscosity affecting the vorticity layer. The viscosity affects the peak shear in each layer similarly, with the peak magnitude in either layer increasing with decreasing $\nu$[TODO 2 plots peak velocity and magnetic shear over all params over time]. This can be attributed to the lack of diffusion at lower $\nu$ allowing the same absolute difference over the shear layer in either velocity or magnetic field to exist in a thinner sheet, resulting in a greater derivative across the layer. In contrast, a decrease in $\eta$ results in a higher peak current density, as expected via a similar argument as above, but a lower peak vorticity [TODO check this]. This can be attributed to... TODO Generally, the properties of the switching layers can be considered a limiting case of the isotropic results with $\nu$ taken to zero.

The distinctive energy profile of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is apparent in the high and medium resistivity switching cases.

There is little dependence on $\nu$ in the switching cases, barring the low resistivity cases.}%

\end{figure}

The stability of KHI in the fan plane is determined via inspection of the out of plane velocity for each parameter choice, summarised in table~\ref{tab:stability}. The stability and nonlinear development is also reflected in the kinetic energies [TODO ref]. For resistivities of $\eta = 10^{-3}$ and $10^{-4}$ using the switching model, there appears in the kinetic energy a signature growth and decay shape, indicative of the KHI[TODO ref]. This is also seen in the single unstable isotropic case, $(\eta, \nu) = (10^{-3}, 10^{-5})$. Isotropic cases $(10^{-3}, 10^{-4})$ and $(10^{-4}, 10^{-3})$ show similar initial increases in kinetic energy, however this does not appear to culminate in instability and we do not notice the small amplitude velocity perturbation seen in other marginally stable cases. Prior to $t = 8$ the kinetic energy in these cases appears similar to the fully unstable cases, but with a more shallow gradient. This is due to TODO WHAT.

TODO Plots of fast mach num, delta and vz over switching and isotropic nu=1e-3, eta=1e-3,-4,-5 at time t=2, 4, 6.

To further explore the observed stability of the KHI, we investigate how the relevant Mach numbers and instability parameters vary radially, and link those to the stability and growth of the KHI. As an indicator of the stability of the shear layer, we plot the Mach number associated with the fast-mode $M_f = \frac{\Delta v}{\sqrt{c_s^2 + c_A^2}}$, where $\Delta v$ is the difference in velocity over the shear layer, and $c_s$ and $c_A$ are the local sound and Alfv\'en speeds, respectively, as well as the parameter $\Delta = \frac{L_B}{L_v}(M_{A, proj})^{2/3}$, where $L_B$ and $L_v$ are the widths of the respective magnetic and velocity shear layers, and $M_{A, proj}$ is the Alfv\'en velocity of the layer after removing the guide field, i.e. $M_{A, proj} = \frac{\Delta v \sqrt{\rho}}{\Delta B}$ (TODO reword this entire sentence). For the layer to be theoretically unstable to the KHI, $M_f < 2$ and $\Delta > 1$.

As a representative sample, we consider the behaviour of both the isotropic and switching models for only $\nu=10^{-3}$ and $\eta$ varying over the range $10^{-5}$--$10^{-3}$.

The KHI appears as early as $t=2$ in the azimuthally averaged velocity in the $z$-direction, for all three values of $\eta$ (TODO fig) and all at approximately the same location, around $r=0.5$. This coincides with the initial peak of $M_f$ (Figure TODO). At this time, only the higher of the three resistivity values allows layers with $\Delta > 1$. At $t=6$, the region where $\Delta>1$ now overlaps with the peak of $M_f$ in the medium resistivity case, and the out of plane velocity shows the expected growth of the instability. In contrast, in the lowest resistivity case, $M_f$ is smaller in magnitude and the profile much flatter than for other values of $\eta$, while $\Delta>1$ only for $r>1$ (Figure TODO). As a result, the initial perturbation that appears around $r=0.5$ doesn't overlap with a region of shear allowing its growth before other factors cause the null to collapse and the current-vortex sheet to be disrupted.

TODO Plots of fast mach num, delta and vz over isotropic eta=1e-3 and varying nu=1e-3, 4, 5 at time t=2, 4, 6.

In a similar fashion, in order to understand the effect of $\nu$, we investigate only the isotropic case over a range of parameters, considering only where $\eta=10^{-3}$ and $\nu$ is in the range $10^{-5}$--$10^{-3}$.

TODO discussion of results

\subsubsection{Reconnection in the KHI}

We now consider the differences in only the switching cases, to investigate the effect of $\nu$ and $\eta$ specifically on the nonlinear development of the KHI. Before the onset the variation in the shear layer properties with $\nu$ are negligible. Generally, the main effects of different values of $\nu$ appear during the nonlinear development of the KHI, around the time $t=9$. After this time, the peaks of both current density and vorticity decrease with decreasing $\nu$ [TODO is this right and if it is why?]. [TODO how to show peaks of current density and vorticity? Another plot of peaks after $t=9$?] As seen in the example case of section~\ref{sec:null_point_khi_single_case} we find evidence of the KHI promoting slippage reconnection for $\eta = 10^{-3}$ and $10^{-4}$, the two values of $\eta$ that allow the KHI TODO plot of rolls in parallel elec field. Where $\eta=10^{-3}$, the reconnection rate varies little with $\nu$, however the rate increases with decreasing $\nu$ where $\eta=10^{-4}$, caused by TODO WHAT. Alongside the sedate, slippage reconnection, we also find evidence of bursty reconnection in the current density for these value of $\eta$ TODO plot, at $t=TODO$ for $\eta=10^{-3}$ and at the later time of $t=11$ for $\eta=10^{-4}$. Since these current structures are close to grid scale, the accuracy of these results should be viewed with caution, but they are an indicator of the potential for the KHI to promote localised, energetic reconnection events. Both slippage and bursty reconnection is evident in the single KHI-unstable isotropic case, where $\nu=10^{-5}$ and $\eta=10^{-3}$.

\subsubsection{The fluting instability}

TODO what is the behaviour of the fluting instability in all cases?

\subsubsection{The collapse of the null}

TODO For which parameters does the null collapse and what does the reconnection look like?

For $\eta=10^{-5}$, the reconnection rate is generally higher than the $10^{-4}$ simulations, particularly along the field lines that intersect the vorticity-current density ring, and along the spine until a reconnection event occurs around $t=10$ in the isotropic cases. The strength of the resultant outflows depend strongly on $\nu$, as does the proceeding reconnection within the rest of the structure, the rate of which is generally higher for weaker viscosity. In the switching case, the initial reconnection event appears sooner and, while the reconnection rate remains relatively constant across the range of $\nu$, lower viscosity does lead to a more violent resultant behaviour.
