  abstract = {Viscous effects are expected to significantly contribute to reconnective energy release mechanisms in solar flares. While simple scaling arguments based on head-on reconnection suggest that viscous dissipation may dominate resistive dissipation, it is not clear whether these findings can be applied in more general merging situations. Here we perform side-by-side planar reconnection simulations driven by the Orszag–Tang vortex, for both classical and Braginskii forms of the viscosity. This formulation has the advantage of providing an autonomous MHD system that develops strong current layers, sustained by large-scale vortical shearing flows. The dissipation rates are shown to follow analytically based scaling laws, which suggest that viscous losses generated from large-scale non-uniform velocity fields are likely to dominate resistive losses in current-sheet reconnection solutions.},

In addition, the measured magnetic compressibility is enhanced at high plasma beta (β∥≳1) along the mirror instability threshold but small elsewhere, consistent with expectations of the mirror mode. We also show that the short wavelength magnetic fluctuation power is a strong function of collisionality, which relaxes the temperature anisotropy away from the instability conditions and reduces correspondingly the fluctuation power.},

  abstract = {It is known from numerical simulations that thermal conduction along magnetic field lines plays an important role in the evolution of the kink instability in coronal loops. This study presents the observational signatures of the kink instability in long coronal loops when parallel thermal conduction is included. The three-dimensional nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic equations are solved numerically to simulate the evolution of a coronal loop that is initially in an unstable equilibrium. The loop has length 80 Mm, width 8 Mm, and an initial maximum twist of Φ = 11.5π , where Φ is a function of the radius. The initial loop parameters are obtained from a highly twisted loop observed in the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) 171 Å wave band. Synthetic observables are generated from the data. These observables include spatial and temporal averaging to account for the resolution and exposure times of TRACE images. Parallel thermal conduction reduces the maximum local temperature by up to an order of magnitude. This means that different spectral lines are formed and different internal loop structures are visible with or without the inclusion of thermal conduction. However, the response functions sample a broad range of temperatures. The result is that the inclusion of parallel thermal conductivity does not have as large an impact on observational signatures as the order of magnitude reduction in the maximum temperature would suggest; the net effect is a blurring of internal features of the loop structure.},

  abstract = {A major problem in astrophysical plasma physics is to explain how the outer atmosphere, the corona, of the Sun is heated to temperatures of millions of degrees Kelvin. It is accepted that the heating mechanism is magnetic, with the energy source being turbulent motions below the solar surface. Two classes of theory are proposed, according to the timescale of the driving motions in relation to the Alfven timescale of the coronal plasma. Fast motions generate MHD waves which propagate up into the corona carrying energy and can heat the corona if the waves are damped. Slow motions move the footpoints of the coronal field, generating field-aligned currents which may dissipate to provide heat. In each case, the main difficulty is in finding an adequate means of dissipation in the highly-conducting coronal plasma. Some proposed heating mechanisms are outlined, which present a number of interesting plasma physics problems closely related to those arising for fusion plasma; in particular, Alfven wave propagation and absorption in a nonuniform medium, and anomalous heating by reconnection, turbulence and relaxation.},

The full Braginskii viscous stress tensor with five viscosity coefficients and electrical resistivity are included in the MHD equations. The coronal loops are approximated by straight, cylindrical, axisymmetric plasma columns with equilibrium quantities which vary only in the radial direction. The simulations are carried out with a numerical code that uses finite elements for the spatial discretization combined with the Galerkin method. Computations in viscous MHD (in the absence of electrical resistivity) show that shear viscosity produces the largest contribution to the absorption and that the contributions due to the compressive and perpendicular components of the viscous stress tensor can be neglected for all practical purposes. Computations in visco-resistive MHD reveal that on the whole it is not possible to distinguish between shear viscosity and electrical resistivity as the most efficient dissipative mechanism for resonant absorption. The relative importance of these two dissipative mechanisms depends on the equilibrium conditions of density and magnetic field strength so that there are situations in which either electrical resisitivity or shear viscosity is the most effective mechanism and in which both mechanisms are equally efficient.},

With the appropriate contributions to the ion stress, all the relevant results existing in the literature concerning the potential stabilization of the ideal and resistive gravitational instabilities of stratified plasma follow. A new result given is that the weakly localized resistive-g instability of stratified plasma in a uniform magnetic field is slowed down due to the ion 'perpendicular' viscosity at lower temperatures, but is essentially unmodified at higher temperatures. Finally, it is noted that the 'parallel' viscosity is quite unimportant in the present Cartesian theory, and that a proper treatment of the influence of magnetic field curvature may well be needed.},

  abstract = {We investigate single-fluid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) with anisotropic viscosity, often referred to as Braginskii MHD, with a particular eye to solar coronal applications. First, we examine the full Braginskii viscous tensor in the single-fluid limit. We pay particular attention to how the Braginskii tensor behaves as the magnetic field strength vanishes. The solar corona contains a magnetic field with a complex and evolving topology, so the viscosity must revert to its isotropic form when the field strength is zero, e.g. at null points. We highlight that the standard form in which the Braginskii tensor is written is not suitable for inclusion in simulations as singularities in the individual terms can develop. Instead, an altered form, where the parallel and perpendicular tensors are combined, provides the required asymptotic behaviour in the weak-field limit. We implement this combined form of the tensor into the Lare3D code, which is widely used for coronal simulations. Since our main focus is the viscous heating of the solar corona, we drop the drift terms of the Braginskii tensor. In a stressed null point simulation, we discover that small-scale structures, which develop very close to the null, lead to anisotropic viscous heating at the null itself (that is, heating due to the anisotropic terms in the viscosity tensor). The null point simulation we present has a much higher resolution than many other simulations containing null points, so this excess heating is a practical concern in coronal simulations. To remedy this unwanted heating at the null point, we develop a model for the viscosity tensor that captures the most important physics of viscosity in the corona: parallel viscosity for strong fields and isotropic viscosity at null points. We derive a continuum model of viscosity where momentum transport, described by this viscosity model, has the magnetic field as its preferred orientation. When the field strength is zero, there is no preferred direction for momentum transport and viscosity reverts to the standard isotropic form. The most general viscous stress tensor of a (single-fluid) plasma satisfying these conditions is found. It is shown that the Braginskii model, without the drift terms, is a specialization of the general model. Performing the stressed null point simulation with this simplified model of viscosity reveals very similar heating profiles to those of the full Braginskii model. The new model, however, does not produce anisotropic heating at the null point, as required. Since the vast majority of coronal simulations use only isotropic viscosity, we perform the stressed null point simulation with isotropic viscosity and compare the heating profiles to those of the anisotropic models. It is shown that the fully isotropic viscosity can overestimate the viscous heating by an order of magnitude.},

With the help of pseudospectral theory, the operators of the linear equations are shown to be highly non-normal, resulting in the possibility of significant transient growth at the onset of the TI. This possibility increases as the Lundquist number

 increases. In particular, we find evidence, numerically, that the maximum possible transient growth, measured in the

We determine the transient growth for tearing-stable and tearing-unstable regimes and discuss the consequences of our results for processes in the solar atmosphere, such as flares and coronal heating. Our results have significant potential impact on how fast current sheets can be disrupted. In particular, transient energy growth due to (asymptotically) damped modes may lead to accelerated current sheet thinning and, hence, a faster onset of the plasmoid instability, compared to the rate determined by the tearing mode alone.},

We conclude, however, that the theoretical models must be more fully developed and the observational uncertainties must be reduced before any definitive statements about specific heating mechanisms can be made.},

  abstract = {We examine the turbulent relaxation of solar coronal loops containing non-trivial field line braiding. Such field line tangling in the corona has long been postulated in the context of coronal heating models. We focus on the observational signatures of energy release in such braided magnetic structures using MHD simulations and forward modeling tools. The aim is to answer the following question: if energy release occurs in a coronal loop containing braided magnetic flux, should we expect a clearly observable signature in emissions? We demonstrate that the presence of braided magnetic field lines does not guarantee a braided appearance to the observed intensities. Observed intensities may—but need not necessarily—reveal the underlying braided nature of the magnetic field, depending on the degree and pattern of the field line tangling within the loop. However, in all cases considered, the evolution of the braided loop is accompanied by localized heating regions as the loop relaxes. Factors that may influence the observational signatures are discussed. Recent high-resolution observations from Hi-C have claimed the first direct evidence of braided magnetic fields in the corona. Here we show that both the Hi-C data and some of our simulations give the appearance of braiding at a range of scales.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic reconnection in a finite diffusion region is completely different in many respects from two-dimensional reconnection at an X-point. In two dimensions a magnetic flux velocity can always be defined: two flux tubes can break at a single point and rejoin to form two new flux tubes. In three dimensions we demonstrate that a flux tube velocity does not generally exist. The magnetic field lines continually change their connections throughout the diffusion region rather than just at one point. The effect of reconnection on two flux tubes is generally to split them into four flux tubes rather than to rejoin them perfectly. During the process of reconnection each of the four parts flips rapidly in a virtual flow that differs from the plasma velocity in the ideal region beyond the diffusion region.},

SOT-Hinode/blue-continuum (4504 Å) observations show that penumbral filaments of positive polarity sunspot have counterclockwise twist, which may be caused by the clockwise rotation of the spot umbrae. The coronal loop, whose one footpoint is anchored in this sunspot, shows strong right-handed twist in chromospheric SOT-Hinode/Ca II H (3968 Å) and coronal TRACE 171 Å images. The length and the radius of the loop are L ∼ 80 Mm and a ∼ 4.0 Mm, respectively. The distance between neighboring turns of magnetic field lines (i.e., pitch) is estimated as ≈10 Mm. The total twist angle, Φ ∼ 12π (estimated for the homogeneous distribution of the twist along the loop), is much larger than the Kruskal-Shafranov instability criterion. We detected clear double structure of the loop top during 04:47 UT-04:51 UT on TRACE 171 Å images, which is consistent with simulated kink instability in curved coronal loops. We suggest that the kink instability of this twisted magnetic loop triggered a B5.0 class solar flare, which occurred between 04:40 UT and 04:51 UT in this active region.},

  abstract = {A WKB method to determine approximations to the critical length for the 
onset of ideal MHD instabilities with high poloidal mode numbers m in
one-dimensional force-free cylindrical models of line-tied coronal loops
is presented, extending the work of Hood et al. (\textbackslash{}cite\{wkb\}) and Van der
Linden \& Hood (\textbackslash{}cite\{vh98\}). Qualitatively, the procedure is similar
to the one used in these two papers and pioneered by Connor et al.
(\textbackslash{}cite\{CHT\}). It is found, however, that the scalings for sheared
force-free equilibria are different from those in the other cases, so
that significant modifications to the method are necessary. The WKB
method developed only requires solving a simple ordinary differential
equation rather than the original set of complicated two-dimensional
partial differential equations. For all force-free sheared equilibria we
find that for large m the marginal stability length behaves like
lc\textasciitilde{} ml0+l2/m compared to lc\textasciitilde{}
ml0+l1 for the unsheared case investigated in Hood
et al. (\textbackslash{}cite\{wkb\}). Thus, it appears that in the force-free (or nearly
force-free) case the m=1 mode is always the first to become unstable.
The WKB results are complemented with numerical solutions of the full
equations and for sufficiently large values of the wave number m
excellent agreement is found. The combination of the results and methods
described in this paper, together with those in Van der Linden \&
Hood (\textbackslash{}cite\{vh98\}) provide all the tools necessary to perform a complete
stability assessment of any one-dimensional cylindrically-symmetric
equilibrium model for a coronal loop.},

  abstract = {Viscosity is discussed in multicomponent partially and fully ionized plasma, and its effects on two very different waves (Alfve´n and Langmuir) in solar atmosphere. A full set of viscosity coefficients is presented which includes coefficients for electrons, protons and hydrogen atoms. These are applied to layers with mostly magnetized protons in solar chromosphere where the Alfve´n wave could in principle be expected. The viscosity coefficients are calculated and presented graphically for the altitudes between 700 and 2200 km, and required corresponding cross-sections for various types of collisions are given in terms of altitude. It is shown that in chromosphere the viscosity plays no role for the Alfve´n wave, which is only strongly affected by ion friction with neutrals. In corona, assuming the magnetic field of a few Gauss, the Alfve´n wave is more affected by ion viscosity than by ion–electron friction only for wavelengths shorter that 1–30 km, dependent on parameters and assuming the perturbed magnetic field of 1 per cent of its equilibrium value. For the Langmuir wave the viscosity–friction interplay in chromosphere is shown to be dependent on altitude and on wavelengths. In corona, the viscosity is the main dissipative mechanism acting on the Langmuir mode.},

  abstract = {Cold fronts—contact discontinuities in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters—should be disrupted by Kelvin–Helmholtz (K-H) instabilities due to the associated shear velocity. However, many observed cold fronts appear stable. This opens the possibility of placing constraints on microphysical mechanisms that stabilize them, such as the ICM viscosity and/or magnetic fields. We performed exploratory high-resolution simulations of cold fronts arising from subsonic gas sloshing in cluster cores using the grid-based Athena MHD code, comparing the effects of isotropic Spitzer and anisotropic Braginskii viscosity (expected in a magnetized plasma). Magnetized simulations with full Braginskii viscosity or isotropic Spitzer viscosity reduced by a factor f ∼ 0.1 are both in qualitative agreement with observations in terms of suppressing K-H instabilities. The rms velocity of turbulence within the sloshing region is only modestly reduced by Braginskii viscosity. We also performed unmagnetized simulations with and without viscosity and find that magnetic fields have a substantial effect on the appearance of the cold fronts, even if the initial field is weak and the viscosity is the same. This suggests that determining the dominant suppression mechanism of a given cold front from X-ray observations (e.g., viscosity or magnetic fields) by comparison with simulations is not straightforward. Finally, we performed simulations including anisotropic thermal conduction, and find that including Braginskii viscosity in these simulations does not significantly affect the evolution of cold fronts; they are rapidly smeared out by thermal conduction, as in the inviscid case.},
